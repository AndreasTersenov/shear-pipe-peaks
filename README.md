# shear-pipe-peaks
Preliminary work using peak counts on CFIS data.

So far you can find in the repo:

**notebooks folder**
- compute_peaks.ipynb: to visualise how peaks are computed from the CFIS mass map with 0.4 arcmin resolution
- constraints_peaks_single_gaussian_kernel.ipynb: to show how the constraints are obtained with Gaussian Processes and MCMC
